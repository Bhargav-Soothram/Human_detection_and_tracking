## Introduction
  Object detection and tracking is a computer vision task that has become essential for many robot applications. The object detection and tracking is the base for autonomous robots in specific. Suppose there is a autonomous delivery robot that is on a mission, it has to identify objects, track them, convert their coordinates to the robot's frame of reference and then try to avoid it. This project is foucussed on solving this problem using existing state-of-art object detection algorithms.

  As per Acme Robotic's requirement, we will use the input from a monocular camera to detect and track an object. This object is then converted to the robot's frame of reference.
